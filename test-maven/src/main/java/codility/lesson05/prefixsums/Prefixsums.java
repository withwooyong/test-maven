/**
 * Problem: You are given a non-empty, zero-indexed array A of n (1 <= n <= 100 000) integers a0, a1, . . . , an−1 (0 <= ai <= 1 000). 
 * This array represents number of mushrooms growing on the consecutive spots along a road. 
 * You are also given integers k and m (0 <= k,m < n).
 * A mushroom picker is at spot number k on the road and should perform m moves. 
 * In one move she moves to an adjacent spot. 
 * She collects all the mushrooms growing on spots she visits. 
 * The goal is to calculate the maximum number of mushrooms that the mushroom picker can collect in m moves.
 * 
 * For example, consider array A such that:
 * 2 3 7 5 1 3 9
 * The mushroom picker starts at spot k = 4 and should perform m = 6 moves. 
 * She might move to spots 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and thereby collect 1+5+7+3+9 = 25 mushrooms. 
 * This is the maximal number of mushrooms she can collect.

	/*
	 * Solution O(m2): Note that the best strategy is to move in one direction optionally followed by some moves in the opposite direction. 
	 * In other words, the mushroom picker should not change direction more than once. 
	 * With this observation we can find the simplest solution.
	 * Make the first p = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,m moves in one direction, then the next m − p moves in the opposite direction. 
	 * This is just a simple simulation of the moves of the mushroom picker which requires O(m2) time.
	 * 
	 * Solution O(n+m): A better approach is to use prefix sums. If we make p moves in one direction, we can calculate the maximal opposite location of the mushroom picker. 
	 * The mushroom picker collects all mushrooms between these extremes. 
	 * We can calculate the total number of collected mushrooms in constant time by using prefix sums.
